## 

This webservice allows you to create, list, and delete webhook subscriptions for various types of events that occur in the system.

For any account, any number of subscriptions, for any combination of events can be created, and different URLs specified for the callbacks, with an option to sign the payload for authorization.

The format of the data that idibu sends as part of the events is standardized and it is up to you to receive, process and understand that data through further use of other related webservices.

All requests are queued and, depending on current traffic, may not arrive immediately.

## Creating or updating a webhook subscription
This method allows you to subscribe to any type of webhooks available in the system.

The `url` specified as part of the subscription is the one that the system will send HTTP requests to whenever the specified event types occur. It also uniquely identifies the webhook - performing the call with the same `url` will update an existing subscription.

The optional `secret` parameter (used to authenticate the requests) will _not_ be returned as part of the [Listing webhook subscriptions](#listing-webhook-subscriptions) method and therefore needs to be managed externally.

### Endpoint
#### `https://ws.idibu.com/ws/rest/v1/webhooks`

### Available methods
#### `POST /`
Sets up a subscription for events specified in the data.

### Query parameters
Parameter Name | Type restrictions | Required? | Notes
-- | -- | -- | --
`hash` | **String** | **Yes** | Hash of the idibu account to which the request pertains.
`data` | **String** | **Yes** | The full query XML (see the [Query format](#query-format) below), URL-encoded within the parameter.

### Query format
```xml
<subscription>
  <url>[string:url]</url> <!-- URL to which the data will be sent whenever the event(s) occur(s); uniquely identifies the webhook -->
  <types>[string]</types> <!-- comma-separated list of event types; see "Available webhook types" below -->
  <secret>[string]</secret> <!-- optional; will be used to sign the webhook HTTP request body using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm with the bytes of the provided 'secret' as a key. The resulting hash is put in the 'Authorization' header of the webhook HTTP request. -->
</subscription>
```

### Response format
```xml
<idibugenerator="idibu" version="1.0">
  <response>[string]</response> <!-- 'Subscription created.' for a new <url> or 'Subscription updated.' for an existing <url>; or an error <message> -->
  <status>["success"|"failed"]</status> <!-- whether the request succeeded or not -->
</idibu>
```

---

## Listing webhook subscriptions
This method allows to list all the webhooks the account is currently subscribed to.

The `secret` parameter (used to authenticate the requests) which can be optionally defined while [Creating or updating a webhook subscription](#creating-or-updating-a-webhook-subscription) will _not_ be returned as part of this call.

### Endpoint
#### `https://ws.idibu.com/ws/rest/v1/webhooks`

### Available methods
#### `GET /`
Lists all webhooks to which the account is currently subscribed.

### Query parameters
Parameter Name | Type restrictions | Required? | Notes
-- | -- | -- | --
`hash` | **String** | **Yes** | Hash of the idibu account to which the request pertains.

### Response format
```xml
<idibugenerator="idibu" version="1.0">
  <response>
    <subscriptions>
      <subscription> <!-- can be multiple -->
        <url>[string:url]</url> <!-- URL to which the data will be sent whenever the event(s) occur(s); uniquely identifies the webhook -->
        <types>[string]</types> <!-- comma-separated list of event types; see "Available webhook types" below -->
        <modified>[string:date]</modified> <!-- last modification date; YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss -->
      </subscription>
    </subscriptions>
  </response>
  <status>["success"|"failed"]</status> <!-- whether the request succeeded or not -->
</idibu>
```

---

## Deleting a webhook subscription
This method allows you to remove an existing webhook subscription.

### Endpoint
#### `https://ws.idibu.com/ws/rest/v1/webhooks`

### Available methods
#### `DELETE /[url]`
Removes the webhook with the provided `[url]`. Please make sure to url-encode the `[url]`.

### Query parameters
Parameter Name | Type restrictions | Required? | Notes
-- | -- | -- | --
`hash` | **String** | **Yes** | Hash of the idibu account to which the request pertains.

### Response format
```xml
<idibugenerator="idibu" version="1.0">
