Welcome to the idibu developer documentation, where you’ll learn how to build an amazing posting and applicant management experience for your customers using the idibu API.

You can choose from a variety of integration options, such as our out-of-the box ‘UPP’ approach (to quickly provide a powerful posting engine and access to our full network of job boards from within your own platform), or for the ultimate in control and flexibility in terms of UI and UX, you can create a full, end-to-end custom API integration. 

We also provide the means to fully whitelabel the idibu experience, which, alongside a ‘pay as you go’ commercial model, allows you to offer the entire idibu experience to your customers under your own branding. 

Before you choose the preferred integration type, make sure to read <a href="https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/blob/master/before-you-begin.md">this</a> article.

Our API documentation is segmented in the following way for ease of use:

1. [idibu posting API] (https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/posting-api) - where you can learn all about posting jobs with our API.

2. [idibu webservices] (https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/webservices) - where you can read how to get the information about your applicants, jobs, users, posting quotas - and much more.

3. [UPP] (https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/blob/master/UPP) - Universal Partner Page - a "plug and play" multiposting integration.

4. [idibu whitelabel] (https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-api/tree/master/whitelabel) - using idibu as a whitelabel platform.

Please note that these applets are designed for the classic idibu platform (often referred as "idibu V2"). The latest release of our product (also known as "idibu V3") is compatible with classic API to some extent, but it uses a separate API - documentation for which can be found [here](https://github.com/oneworldmarket/idibu-v3-api). Please note, integration with ‘idibu V3’ is reserved for commercial CRM’s looking to build a strategic partnership with idibu, as opposed to a ‘fully whitelabled’ (or reseller) solution.
